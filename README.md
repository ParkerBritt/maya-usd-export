This repository provides a standalone Maya plugin for exporting USD (Universal Scene Description) files. It also includes a lightweight GUI for convenience and quick integration into tools and workflows.
  
While the functionality is similar to Autodesk's maya-usd plugin, this version is designed for modularity and ease of use. It does not require maya-usd, but remains compatible with it. This makes it simpler to modify and embed in other projects.

Future development will aim for feature parity with maya-usd, alongside new functionality such as reverse winding orders.
